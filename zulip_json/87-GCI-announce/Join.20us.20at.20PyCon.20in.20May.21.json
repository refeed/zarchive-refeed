Zulip will have an in-person event at <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2017/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://us.pycon.org/2017/\">PyCon North America</a> in Portland, Oregon, May 22-25, 2017. Every year at PyCon North America, there are \"sprints\" where people from open source projects work together in person. We plan on having a Zulip sprint at PyCon next year, just like we did <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2016/community/sprints/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://us.pycon.org/2016/community/sprints/\">last year</a>. We hope you'll join us. It's a great opportunity to meet us in person, hack and write with us, and learn from each other.</p>\n<p>If you want to come but you can't afford the cost of travel, lodging, registration, and/or childcare, please apply for financial aid soon:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2017/financial-assistance/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://us.pycon.org/2017/financial-assistance/\">https://us.pycon.org/2017/financial-assistance/</a></p>\n<p>The deadline for applying is February 15, 2017.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We actively encourage people to apply for financial aid.</p>\n<p>The PSF welcomes and encourages applications from students.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, even though you are a teenager, you can apply for financial aid. I emailed PyCon to ask about teenagers 13-17 years old, and PyCon said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anyone under the age of 16 should have a guardian with them. If they are 16 or 17, we would request a consent form signed by their parents.</p>\n<p>Feel free to have them apply for financial aid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Zulip is not in charge of this financial aid stuff and I have no power to grant it -- the money comes from the Python Software Foundation.
