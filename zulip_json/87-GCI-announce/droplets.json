There is still a lot to be done, and we hope many of you continue showing up in chat and in our PR review queues in the upcoming weeks, months, and years :). </p>\n<p>That being said, by default we'll be decommissioning all the droplets tomorrow or the day after. We still have the ability to keep a good number running, so if you're still using yours, please let me know! When you let me know, also let me know if you're planning on using it for O(week) to get some last PRs merged (in which case I'll ping you again next week), or whether you're thinking of using it for longer. </p>",
