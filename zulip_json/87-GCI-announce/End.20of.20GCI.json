Thank you to all the mentors for putting so many hours of work in helping us students contribute to Zulip. I'd also like to thank the community for being so kind and supportive. It was really nice to see students and mentors helping each other out with their tasks. GCI was definitely a great experience for me because of this positive atmosphere. I look forward to participating in GCI again next year and contributing more to Zulip and other open source projects! :D</p>",

Looking back, it was probably one of my most joyful moments as a programmer to see my first contribution, (a hello-world.md doc!!) being merged :P.
