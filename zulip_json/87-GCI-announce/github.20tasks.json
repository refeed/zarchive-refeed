We'd like to take care of as much of the bookkeeping for this as we can over the weekend, so if you could send it to me (either reply here or send me a PM) in the next 24 hours that would be great. Note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As per GCI rules, this only applies to issues you worked on after GCI started (Nov 28)</li>\n<li>If you have a merged/nearly-merged PR not attached to a github issue or GCI task, send it over anyway.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
