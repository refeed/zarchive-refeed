<p>We are encouraging students to review each other's work.  We have created a new stream called <a class="stream" data-stream-id="91" href="/#narrow/stream/GCI%20peer%20review">#GCI peer review</a>.  Sorry if you have seen multiple announcements for this, but we wanted to make sure everybody was aware of it.  It's a public stream, so anybody can subscribe.</p>
