<p>To clarify our workflow a bit - we often check submissions locally on feature branches. <br>
<br>
If you want to change an already submitted task, please ask on chat first and make sure a mentor is not checking it at the moment - it might interfere with the workflow, especially if your submission requires a certain setup to be properly checked. <br>
<br>
Also, it will restart Travis and part of checking the submission is using Travis to check if the tests pass.<br>
<br>
I've had to restart reviewing a few submissions due to changes while in the queue and it slows down the review process.</p>

<p>tl;dr - you should always ask before changing a submission that's in the queue</p>
