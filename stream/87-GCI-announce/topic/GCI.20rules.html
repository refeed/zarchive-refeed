<p>If you're waiting for a review, reading the <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/resources/contest-rules" target="_blank" title="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/resources/contest-rules">GCI rules</a> could clarify any doubts about claiming tasks and working on them.<br>
<br>
I think this might be of particular interest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4.2     Claiming a Task. To work on a task, you must first claim it by clicking the “Claim this task” button, subject to the following:<br>
(a)     you may only claim one (1) task at a time;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should thus claim a task before you start working on it and remember you can only have one task claimed at a time.<br>
<br>
We've been encouraging you to find other ways of spending your time productively - helping other students, reading articles from the <a href="https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/GCI.20general/topic/reading.20list" target="_blank" title="https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/GCI.20general/topic/reading.20list">reading list</a> and learning. The number of tasks is not the only factor we'll take into account. Your engagement, quality of your work and value for the community will be equally important.<br>
<br>
Please do adhere to the GCI rules - we can't change them and need to enforce them to make sure all the students are treated with fairness they deserve.</p>
