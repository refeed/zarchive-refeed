<p>GCI is coming to an end soon and I just wanted to thank all the mentors for being so helpful and generous with their time. I (along with many of my fellow students) have really enjoyed GCI this year and I know that the mentors at Zulip have made a huge contribution to this.  Thanks! <img alt=":+1:" class="emoji" src="/static/generated/emoji/images/emoji/+1.png" title=":+1:"> </p>

<p>Hi! Just wanted to also say thanks, I've not really been as engaged as I probably should have been over the duration of GCI, but I'm glad I took part and got a little taster of the experience, and I'll probably be around occasionally, and will hopefully be able to contribute more once I get a bit more experience with django etc. ^.^</p>

<p>As GCI comes to a close, I'd just like to thank all the mentors that helped me out! Learning to rebase and squash commits was really <a href="https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/GCI.20help/subject/Some.20Github.20problems" target="_blank" title="https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/GCI.20help/subject/Some.20Github.20problems">confusing</a> in the beginning, but thanks to the support of the community, I was enable to learn so many things about Git! Thank you to all the mentors for putting so many hours of work in helping us students contribute to Zulip. I'd also like to thank the community for being so kind and supportive. It was really nice to see students and mentors helping each other out with their tasks. GCI was definitely a great experience for me because of this positive atmosphere. I look forward to participating in GCI again next year and contributing more to Zulip and other open source projects! :D</p>

<p>Now that GCI has officially ended, I also want to express my biggest thanks to all of you!! Thanks to the mentors for being there when we needed help, for reviewing, motivating, all with an admirable patience. Thanks to all fellow students for peer-reviewing and helping out wherever they could. Looking back, it was probably one of my most joyful moments as a programmer to see my first contribution, (a hello-world.md doc!!) being merged :P. It would be great if it was somehow possible to keep up the feeling of GCI . Maybe we could create a "GCI-2017" stream for everyone involved in this year's GCI?</p>

<p>Created!  This is a public stream.  I think the expectation for this stream is that anybody can join, but you should expect that most mentors will not subscribe to it.  For questions where mentors may help, I would go back to GCI general.</p>

<p>This seems to be it! Well, I also wanted to thank you all for making of my last year of GCI such a pleasure. I've met people who I expect to stay in touch with, and I'm definitely staying as a contributor. Also a big "thank you!" to all of you who have dedicated so much time and effort in the GCI.<br>
Let's see if I can manage to pass from mentoree to mentor in next year's edition ;)<br>
Keep on rocking, guys!</p>
